# aesthetic-ify

Aesthetic Spotify Audio Visualizer created with ReactJS and Spotify API.

Here is a website that will totally level up your setup!

aesthetic-ify connects with your Spotify account and shows you what song you are currently listening to, by who, and the album cover. 
It also gives you an audio visualizer of the music for some extra flair. The use of this project is simply for people who care about their looks and want something different for their setup.
